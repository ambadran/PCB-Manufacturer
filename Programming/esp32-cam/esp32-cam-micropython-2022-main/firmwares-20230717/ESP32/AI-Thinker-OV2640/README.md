There are three versions of firmwares:

1. WiFi-SSL - With WiFi, Sockets and SSL 
2. BLE - Includes BLE and no WiFi
3. BTC - With Bluetooth classic, without BLE and WiFi

For more information, please refer to previous notes in this repository.

These firmwares are not fully tested, my apologies in advance if they do not work as expected.
